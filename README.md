The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign using machine learning. Early diagnosis can significantly increases the chances of survival of Breast cancer patient. Machine learning techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis. Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.  In this case study, the task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features from several cell images.
